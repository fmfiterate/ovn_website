  heading: Why Open Voice Network?
  text: >-
    The Open Voice Network (OVN) seeks to share voice with everyone by creating
    a future for artificial intelligence-enabled voice (AI-voice) search,
    communication, and commerce that is open: standards-based, interoperable,
    accessible, and data-protected.

    Artificial Intelligence-enables Voice Assistance – such as Amazon's Alex,
    Apple's Siri, Samsung's Bixby, or Google Home – will soon be a primary
    interface for all digital devices, from smart speakers and smartphones to
    automobiles and appliances. We are moving rapidly into a post-type and
    -touch world.

      The AI-voice market leaders have created proprietary, soloed, and gated
      AI-voice platforms and ecosystems. As AI-voice availability and adoption
      grows, proprietary AI-voice platforms will extract ever-greater value from
      commerce brands, in data collection, SEO, and access tolls.

      AI-voice currently gives brands a window into users' emotion and health –
      with positive and negative implications.

      To participate with the proprietary AI-voice platforms, consumer-facing
      brands must now give up control, direct contact, and customer data –
      unless we act now.

  text: >-
    Open Voice Network members will help shape the future of commerce – in
    increasingly critical issues of technology, competition, and commercial and
    personal information privacy. The Open Voice Network is a directed fund
    project of The Linux Foundation, and as such, also supports the Foundation's
    broader mission of helping establish, build, and sustain some of the most
    critical open source technologies.
