    AI-voice assistance will soon be a primary interface for all digital
    devices, from smart speakers and smartphones to automobiles and appliances.
    It will have an impact across every phase of the shopper decision journey.
    Currently, a few major market leaders are the gatekeepers and hold access to
    data-rich AI-voice communication.

      Broad data rights are claimed by a small number of proprietary AI-voice
      market leaders who have created proprietary, siloed, and gated AI-voice
      platforms and ecosystems.

      As AI-voice grows, proprietary platforms will extract even greater value
      and data from commerce brands, threatening consumers and all
      consumer-facing companies.
