    We are moving rapidly into a post-type and -touch world. Currently, a few
    major market leaders are the gatekeepers and hold access to data-rich
    communication from users to commerce brands. Artificial Intelligence-enables
    Voice Assistance – such as Amazon's Alex, Apple's Siri, Samsung's Bixby or
    Google Home – will soon be a primary interface for all digital devices, from
    smart speakers and smartphones to automobiles and appliances.
intro:
  heading: Why Open Voice Network?
  text: >-
    The Open Voice Network (OVN) seeks to share voice with everyone by creating
    a future for artificial intelligence-enabled voice (AI-voice) search,
    communication, and commerce that is open: standards-based, interoperable,
    accessible, and data-protected.

      A small number of proprietary AI-voice market leaders have created
      proprietary, soloed, and gated AI-voice platforms and ecosystems. These
      platforms claim broad data rights.

      As AI-voice grows, proprietary platforms will extract ever greater value
      and data from commerce brands, threatening consumers and all
      consumer-facing companies.
