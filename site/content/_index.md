    AI-voice assistance will soon be a primary interface for all digital
    devices, from smart speakers and smartphones to automobiles and appliances.
    It will have an impact across every phase of the shopper decision journey.
    Currently, a few major market leaders are the gatekeepers and hold access to
    data-rich communication from users to commerce brands.

      A small number of proprietary AI-voice market leaders have created
      proprietary, siloed, and gated AI-voice platforms and ecosystems. These
      platforms claim broad data rights.

      As AI-voice grows, proprietary platforms will extract ever greater value
      and data from commerce brands, threatening consumers and all
      consumer-facing companies.
