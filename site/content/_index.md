  heading: Why Open Voice Network?
  text: >-
    The Open Voice Network (OVN) seeks to share voice with everyone by creating
    a future for artificial intelligence-enabled voice (AI-voice) search,
    communication, and commerce that is open: standards-based, interoperable,
    accessible, and data-protected.

    Artificial Intelligence-enables Voice Assistance – such as Amazon's Alex,
    Apple's Siri, Samsung's Bixby, or Google Home – will soon be a primary
    interface for all digital devices, from smart speakers and smartphones to
    automobiles and appliances. We are moving rapidly into a post-type and
    -touch world.

      AI-voice interactions are data-rich. Voice expands the whole notion of
      available personal information. It is a delivery mechanism and window into
      emotion and health, and eavesdropping.

      Voice will be importance in commerce. In the future, shoppers will connect
      to brands – and brands to shoppers – through AI-voice. A small number of
      proprietary AI-voice platforms now dominate the Europe-North America voice
      markets that are not interoperable and they claim the data in
      platform-based interactions.

    Open Voice Network members will help shape the future of commerce – in
    increasingly critical issues of technology, competition, and commercial and
    personal information privacy. The Open Voice Network is a directed fund
    project of The Linux Foundation, and as such, also supports the Foundation's
    broader mission of helping establish, build, and sustain some of the most
    critical open source technologies.
