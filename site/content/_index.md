    Open Voice Network members will help shape the future of commerce – in
    increasingly critical issues of technology, competition, and commercial and

    project of The Linux Foundation, and as such, also supports the Foundation's
    broader mission of helping establish, build, and sustain some of the most
    critical open source technologies.
