      The Open Voice Network emerged from 2016-2018 research on the potential of
      AI-voice in commerce conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Laboratory, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel
      Corporation. In late 2018, seed funding was provided to initiate academic
      research into AI-voice technologies and standards, and to develop the Open
      Voice Network.
