      The Open Voice Network (OVN) seeks to share voice with everyone by
      creating a future for artificial intelligence-enabled voice (AI-voice)
      search, communication, and commerce that is open: standards-based,
      interoperable, and data-protected.  The OVN is a directed fund project of
      The Linux Foundation.  It is global in scope, and inclusive of
      consumer-facing entities, both private and public.

      The Open Voice Network will deliver its vision of open voice through
      technology and usage research that leads to proposal and adoption of
      global standards, best-practice sharing, and industry advocacy.

      The Open Voice Network emerged from 2016-2018 research on the potential of
      AI-voice in commerce conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Laboratory, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel
      Corporation.  In late 2018, Target Corporation provided seed funding to
      initiate academic research into AI-voice technologies and standards, and
      to establish the Open Voice Network. The OVN is now a directed fund
      project of The Linux Foundation.
