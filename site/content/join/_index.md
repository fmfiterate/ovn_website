        The AI-voice market leaders have created proprietary, soloed, and gated
        AI-voice platforms and ecosystems. These platforms claim broad data
        rights. As AI-voice grows, proprietary platforms will extract ever
        greater value and data from commerce brands.

      text: >-
        A small number of proprietary AI-voice platforms now dominate the
        Europe-North America voice markets that are not interoperable and claim
        data in platform-based interactions. In an era of increasing AI-voice
        adoption, this situation threatens consumers and all consumer-facing
        companies.

      Our Industry is facing an era where digital and physical are switching
      roles, for selling and for marketing and communication. Because of this
      blurring situation, we must push to create more cooperation across
      technologies and providers in order to build up our future together.

    quote: "Voice has the potential to deliver the ultimate convenience and ease for consumers.\_Brands will have the ability to engage with a more intimate and advisory consumer relationships. But as voice-commerce begins to replace todayâ€™s point and click purchasing, retailers and brands face significant challenges for leveraging voice-first devices."
