        The AI-voice market leaders have created proprietary, soloed, and gated
        AI-voice platforms and ecosystems. These platforms claim broad data
        rights. As AI-voice grows, proprietary platforms will extract ever
        greater value and data from commerce brands.

      text: >-
        A small number of proprietary AI-voice platforms now dominate the
        Europe-North America voice markets that are not interoperable and claim
        data in platform-based interactions. In an era of increasing AI-voice
        adoption, this situation threatens consumers and all consumer-facing
        companies.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
