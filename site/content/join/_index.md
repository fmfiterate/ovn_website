        The AI-voice market leaders have created proprietary, soloed, and gated
        AI-voice platforms and ecosystems. These platforms claim broad data
        rights. As AI-voice grows, proprietary platforms will extract ever
        greater value and data from commerce brands.

        OVN will drive industry awareness and advocacy of the opportunity,
        challenges and impact of AI-voice in consumer-facing industries. We will
        sponsor research that will explore, develop and assert standards and
        technologies of open voice.

        A small number of proprietary AI-voice platforms now dominate the
        Europe-North America voice markets that are not interoperable and claim
        data in platform-based interactions. In an era of increasing AI-voic
        adoption, this situation threatens consumers and all consumer-facing
        companies.

        We will work to create a "Voice Name System (VNS)" for voice, similar to
        the DNS of the internet. A global, standards-based repository for
        AI-voice wake words. An open, standards-based reference architecture
        that enables every brand to find its voice.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
