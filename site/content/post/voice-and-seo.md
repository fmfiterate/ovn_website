description: How will voice-search affect SEO for brands?
---
AI-voice will soon be a primary interface to the internet. We’re on that path now.

We talk to the internet, and it talks back. In time, talk will evolve to dialogue and dialogue will evolve to the give and take of human-like conversation.

Voice is now in its early days. Similar to the early, browser-war days of the internet. Access is limited. Interoperability, nil. Usage is cramped and constrained in walled gardens.

And some very big questions wait for answers.

One of the most important questions for enterprise users is that of voice-based search.

The Open Voice Network has found

voicebot.ai

to be a good source of informative articles and reports.

For the to

How important is

voice search?

Very.

Google itself reported that voice was the interface for 20

percent of its 2018 mobile search. Serious calculations suggest that voice was close to 13

percent of Google’s 2018 total search volume. One in eight, tre

nding toward one in seven

internet searches. In total, some

250 billion voice

\-

based searches

.

Will the voice search number go up or go down? Well, given that there are now more than two

billion devices worldwide that provide voice assistant access, th

e trend line will rise.

N
